#Ger-Ball

A 3D platformer prototype created in UE4. Use gravity-changing abilities to cross obstacles. This prototype features a gravity-weakener.
By holding L-shift, the player can reduce the strength of gravity to cross larger gaps and taller objects. Very early prototype, no proper
models or textures added. 

CONTROLS:
- Move = WASD
- Jump = Space
- Camera = Mouse
- Gravity Shift = L-Shift
